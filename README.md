# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Portfolio - Tharun Pranav

## 📖 About This Repository
This repository serves as a practical portfolio documenting my hands-on experience with cybersecurity concepts, specifically aligned with the **CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701)** framework. 

It contains detailed lab reports, evidence of execution, and analysis of security operations, demonstrating the transition from theoretical knowledge to operational tradecraft.

## 🔬 Featured Project: Endpoint Security & Network Forensics

### **📄 [Click Here to View the Full Lab Report](Endpoint_Security_Lab_Report.md)**

**Objective:** To conduct a comprehensive security audit of a Windows endpoint using native "Living off the Land" (LotL) techniques. The goal was to identify indicators of compromise (IoCs), map the local network attack surface, and validate system hardening measures.

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
* **Reconnaissance:** `arp -a`, `Test-NetConnection` (PowerShell)
* **Threat Hunting:** `netstat -ano`, `tasklist`, Process PID correlation
* **Forensics:** `ipconfig /displaydns` (DNS Cache Analysis)
* **Hardening:** `netsh advfirewall` (Windows Defender Firewall Auditing)
* **Environment:** Windows 11, Docker, VirtualBox

### 💡 Key Skills Demonstrated
* ✅ **Network Discovery:** Mapped local subnets and identified devices using MAC OUI fingerprinting.
* ✅ **Port Scanning:** Performed internal vulnerability assessments to identify open service ports (HTTP, Cast Protocol).
* ✅ **Incident Response:** Analyzed volatile memory artifacts (DNS cache) to reconstruct user browsing history and detect potential C2 beacons.
* ✅ **System Hardening:** Audited and optimized firewall profiles to enforce "Block Inbound" policies for Zero Trust security.
